=Dependecies=
- Boost 1.4.x ( tested with 1.4.7.0 and 1.4.8.0 )
- Gloox 1.0
- soci ( optional )

=Building=
Either use the supplied Code::Blocks project file or the included Makefile

=Configuration=
Either create a copy of the example config-file in the bin/ subfolder and adapt
it to suit your needs and start the bot with
